# Comparing Sorting Algorithms in Rust and c

## Bogo sort
<b>Description: </b> Bogo sort shuffles an array until it finds the right solution. My implementation of bogo sort randomly shuffles an array (there is also a deterministic solution) so it basically just guesses until it guesses right. For an 11 length array, my Rust solution takes 12 seconds to guess the right answer. I couldn't test larger arrays becuase it would take too long to run. So, yeah. It's pretty slow. We can do better.  
<b>Time complexity: </b> I don't even want to know.  
<b>Space complexity: </b> O(n)
